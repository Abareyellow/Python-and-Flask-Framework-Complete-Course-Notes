Class and Objects

- OOP languages -> Object is simply a collection of data and methods that act those data. Classes are blueprints for an object

- An object is an instance of a class and the process of creating this object is called instantiation.

List Vs. Tuples

List - Elements can be change once it is assigned (mutable)

Tuples - Elements can not be change once it is assigned (immutable)

Advantage of Tuples:

- Can iterate faster than a list
- Good for Heterogeneous datatypes
- Elements can ne used as keys for a dictionary
- Data that does not change
 <Tuple can reassigned >

Sets

D - a set is an unordered collection of unique items.

- No duplicate elements are allowed in set and must be immutable
- However, we can add or remove items from it.
- Perform operations like union, intersection, symmetric differemce etc.

Dictionary

D - an unordered collection of item

- key: value pair
- optimized to retrieve values when the key is known
